# babylon-eyes

Bablyon-eyes shows a number of eyes following a red ball moving in a 3D space.

This hack is the result of a short hackathlon event where I and [@fredrikj](https://github.com/fredrikj) wanted to learn more about [babylon.js](https://babylonjs.com). 

Focus was to get something working quickly and thus code quality had to suffer. We had no prior knowledge of babylon.js which explains some oddities in the code.

**Run hack**

- Navigate to babylon.js in a browser
- Click on Playground
- Choose "TypeScript"
- Copy/paste the code in playground.ts into the text area.
- Click on the Play button
